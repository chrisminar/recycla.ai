### Recycle is learning to read!
Recycla is learning to read! You can help it learn by showing your items with the text facing the camera. 

The following images show some examples of Recycla reading and deciphering images to produce a grocery list. The red boxes show where text was found and the title is either the extracted grocery list item or tells you it couldn't detect something reasonable for a grocery list.
