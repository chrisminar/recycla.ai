## Camera setup

 * Recycla functions best when operating with a clean background. For best results, ensure the background is pointing at a clean uniform surface.  
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/good_background.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="good background" width="512">
</div>

 * The Recycla camera should be tilted up slightly to avoid the recycling bin being the field of view of the camera.  
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/tilt.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Recycla tilt" width="512">
</div>

 * Avoid letting recycling build up into the field of view of the camera.  
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/bad_background.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="recycle position" width="512">
</div>

 * For best results, use in a well lit area.
