# How to get the most out of your Recycla

## Camera setup

 * Recycla functions best when operating with a clean background. For best results, ensure the background is pointing at a clean uniform surface.  
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/good_background.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="good background" width="512">
</div>

 * The Recycla camera should be tilted up slightly to avoid the recycling bin being the field of view of the camera.  
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/tilt.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Recycla tilt" width="512">
</div>

 * Avoid letting recycling build up into the field of view of the camera.  
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/bad_background.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="recycle position" width="512">
</div>

 * For best results, use in a well lit area.

## App setup

1. To get the app on your phone you will first have to accept the invite sent to your apple account email.
2. Download the test flight app on the store.
3. Tell Chris to send the invite for Recycla. I have to do this manually and can't start it until you accept the first invite.
4. Use the code in the Recycla invite email in test flight.
5. Use test flight to download the app.
6. Before you get started using Recycla you need to link your account to the camera. Tap the settings wheel at the bottom then the manage pis button.

7. Find the serial number of your Camera, the first few digits will be written on the case. Then swipe right to claim.

</div>

8. Be sure to submit feedback and suggestions through test flight!

## Recycling
 * When recycling, place the object in front of the camera and hold for about 1 second, then drop. Ideally the object should not be too close to the camera, and centered in its field of view.  
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/positioning.png' | relative_url }}" alt="recycle position">
</div>

 * When it's time to take out the recycling, turn the power off. This will prevent unwanted triggers.
 * After you turn the device on it takes about 2 minutes for it to be ready to record. The app will give you a notification when the camera is ready. 
 * You can check the status of the device at any time by looking at the color of the dot next to "Your Pis" in the settings Page.
 * After you recycle something, it takes about 8 seconds for the device to be ready to recycle again.

## Updating
 * The app will be updated through test flight. I don't think it's possible to make this automatic.
 * You will get an email notifiaction when there is a new version of the app.
 * The Camera will look for new firmware every night. 
 * The Camera will look for new firmware when it boots (turns on).

## Other Tips
 * The Recycla camera is not waterproof! There is a full computer inside the case, which has lots of ventillation ports. Please take care not to get the device wet.
