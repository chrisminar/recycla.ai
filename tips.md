# How to get the most out of your Recycla

## Recycling
 * When recycling, place the object in front of the camera and hold for about 1 second, then drop. Ideally the object should not be too close to the camera, and centered in its field of view.  
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/positioning.png' | relative_url }}" alt="recycle position">
</div>

 * When it's time to take out the recycling, turn the power off. This will prevent unwanted triggers.
 * After you turn the device on it takes about 2 minutes for it to be ready to record. The app will give you a notification when the camera is ready. 
 * You can check the status of the device at any time by looking at the color of the dot next to "Your Pis" in the settings Page.
 * After you recycle something, it takes about 8 seconds for the device to be ready to recycle again.

## Updating
 * The app will be updated through test flight. I don't think it's possible to make this automatic.
 * You will get an email notifiaction when there is a new version of the app.
 * The Camera will look for new firmware every night. 
 * The Camera will look for new firmware when it boots (turns on).

## Other Tips
 * The Recycla camera is not waterproof! There is a full computer inside the case, which has lots of ventillation ports. Please take care not to get the device wet.
 * When in doubt, restart the device and/or app.
