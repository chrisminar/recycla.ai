Welcome to Recycla! Recycla is a project I've been working on that tracks what you recycle. It uses a camera that you place on your recycle bin, and an iphone app.  

When you recycle something, the Recycla camera detects that motion and uses machine learning to understand what is being recycled. That information gets stored in the cloud and summarized for you in the Recycla ios app.
